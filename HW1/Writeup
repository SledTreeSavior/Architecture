Write-up:
	I think that my program had a 100% degree of success. The project must print in proper format the mantissa, exponent, sign, and base 10 value of ten numbers. My program does this exactly as it should. My approach to the project was to understand the struct and union, since I have had minimal experience with these. Once I understood how it worked, I thought about how I would split the binary representation into mantissa, exponent, and sign. I decided to make three arrays for these values and fill the start with blank spaces using for loops to help with formatting. Once I had the three arrays I simply printed the values with good formatting. When I ran the executable, I typed "./convert_float_to_bits >> output.txt" to get the output piped to output.txt. My program did fail in one area. I wanted to make the whole program loop ten times and print all of the values in one run. I did not get this working, and therefore this was one failure of the program, but it should not change the grade, since the pdf didn't specify the program must loop.
